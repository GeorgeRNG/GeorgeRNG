- 👋 Hi, I’m @GeorgeRNG
- 👀 I’m interested in Python, Mostly discord bots. I'm also doing lots of js (with html) for mcdiamondfire related projects.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, and how to host a discord bot
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a discord bot
- 📫 I will replace this text with my discord thing ! 1 -\- 1 !#8351 which might change so have my id 577082051895754782 so paste <@577082051895754782> to mention me anywhere and click that to do stuff. (This line actually got updated howee 🥔)
